This is a starter desktop application using nw.js
that is a simple SQLite UI for working on HTMLY.

It may become part of the main HTMLY-Desktop application,
or as a standalone general SQLite viewer application unrelated
to HTMLY, as HTMLY-Desktop is probably at this time going to 
end up being developed using Kotlin.

In other words, this is a 'meta' dev tool for the development 
and POC work for HTMLY.
