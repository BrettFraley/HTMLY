        <h3>Principle Idea</h3>

        <p>HTMLY is an idea and exploratory research project by <a href="https://brettfraley.github.io">Brett Fraley</a>
        and <a href="https://yown.info">YOWN Software & Media</a>.
        The project aims to define a spec, various implementations, and the the core features that make up
        a website or software application driven by HTMLY.</p>

        <p>The forseen specification involves the combination of static site generation, server side rendering,
        and composable blocks of dynamic content stored using SQLite.</p>

        <p>On top of defining HTMLY as an actual software spec, we are building HTMLY Desktop that
        features powerful development tools for using or implementing HTMLY websites and services.</p>

        <p>Services? Yes, HTMLY is not just for static or dynamic website or applications, it is a general purpose
        spec for creating all kinds of software tools and web services.</p>

        <p>The initial concepts of HTMLY are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All markup, content, and code is in a SQLite database.</li>
            <li>Websitess, apps, and other software can be built from sets of database schemas and queries.</li>
            <li>Changes to data triggers content blocks to be regenerated, sent to users,
                and only the changed content blocks are reloaded.</li>
            <li>Dynamic content is updated and sent to users via SSE or websockets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Notes: Jan 17, 2025</h3>

        <p>We've realized that HTMLY has two main stages of research and development.
           The first is the spec itself as an idea and the second is initial and future
           implementations of HTMLY driven or inspired applications using different types
           of stacks (meaning use of different database engines or configurations, programming languages,
           integrations with web frameworks, and the testing of these implementations).
        </p>

        <p>There is a third major piece to our development, which mentioned above, is HTMLY-Desktop.
            A variety of considerations have gone into starting development on HTMLY-Desktop, and while NW.js
            and other multiplatform desktop development tools have been considered, we are initially choosing Kotlin
            as our development language.
            <strong>NOTE: </strong>We want to experiment with using bash, Crystal, Go, and other languages
            for the fastest watching of database changes, server side rendering and SSE servers, but we realize that
            this may be left up to users to experiment with themselves and make those decisions based on their preference
            and requirements.
        </p>

        <h4>Current Work / Goals</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Continued R&D on the idea(s) and creating the initial spec definition of HTMLY.</li>
            <li>Gradually develop HTMlY-Desktop.</li>
            <li>Build example websites, documentation, and tutorials.</li>
        </ul>
